# sWAF - A simple WAF docker image

**sWAF** is a **simple Web Application Firewall** docker image, pre-configured to be easily used within your web services. It runs [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) as a dedicated reverse proxy with [ModSecurity v3](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/tree/v3/master) and [NAXSI](https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi) for the security layers, all over an [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) image. The goal is to offer a simple WAF docker image acting as a security device ready to be deploy wherever into your network infrastructure:

**[Web Client]** --`hxxp(s)://my.owncloud.com`--> **[SWAF (Listeners>TLS>Security>rProxying)]** --`hxxp(s)://my.owncloud.local`--> **[mywebservice1]**
